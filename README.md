# SpigotMazeGenerator
A work in progress plugin that generates mazes in minecraft using the recursive backtracking algorithm.

You can change maze sizes in MazeStructurePopulator.java. All mazes can be found in super flat worlds at 0, 4, 0. Mazes in non flat worlds are currently broken and will be fixed in the next release (which is a few days out).
